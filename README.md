# Predictive Maintenance AI Algorithm

## Overview
This project focuses on developing an AI-based predictive maintenance algorithm for dishwashing machines. The algorithm utilizes a provided dataset containing temperature and vibration sensor readings under different health conditions: good, moderate, and bad. The primary objective is to create an accurate model capable of predicting when a dishwashing machine will require maintenance based on the sensor data.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of temperature and vibration sensor readings categorized into three health conditions:

- **Good:** Normal operating conditions.
- **Moderate:** Conditions indicating potential issues that may lead to maintenance.
- **Bad:** Critical conditions requiring immediate maintenance.

## Data Preprocessing

### Handling Missing Values

#### Temperature Sensor
- Apply median imputation to handle missing values in temperature sensor readings.
